# Ascon-AEAD128 --- SystemVerilog Implementation

This repository contains a **SystemVerilog model of the Ascon-AEAD128
authenticated encryption algorithm**, developed as part of a *Digital
System Design* project.\
The objective is to reproduce the behavior of the Ascon algorithm ---
selected by the **NIST (National Institute of Standards and
Technology)** as a cryptographic standard --- using hardware description
techniques.

## Overview

**Ascon-AEAD128** is an *Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
(AEAD)* algorithm.
It ensures both **confidentiality** and **authenticity** of messages by
producing a verification tag.

The SystemVerilog model implements all the main components of the
algorithm:

-   Constant addition module
-   Substitution layer (S-box)
-   Linear diffusion layer
-   Permutation round
-   State machine (control logic)
-   Top-level integration with testbench

## Algorithm Description

The algorithm operates on a **320-bit internal state**, divided into
five 64-bit registers:

    S = {S0, S1, S2, S3, S4}

-   **External part:** Sr = {S0, S1} → 128 bits
-   **Internal part:** Sc = {S2, S3, S4} → 192 bits

The encryption process includes four main phases:

1.  **Initialization** -- The state is initialized using an IV, secret
    key (K), and nonce (N), followed by permutation `p12` and key
    mixing.
2.  **Associated Data Processing** -- Each padded 128-bit block is XORed
    with the external state, followed by permutation `p8`.
3.  **Plaintext Processing** -- Each plaintext block is XORed with the
    external state to produce ciphertext, followed by two `p8`
    permutations.
4.  **Finalization** -- After a final permutation `p12`, a tag is
    generated by XORing with the key.

## Modules


  **Addition of Constant (Pc)** : Adds a round-dependent constant to
                                register S2.

  **Substitution Layer**        : Substitutes 5-bit words using a
                                predefined S-box.

  **Linear Diffusion**          : Applies XOR and cyclic rotations to
                                spread information.

  **Permutation**               : Combines the three previous operations in
                                sequence per round.

  **State Machine**             : Controls the flow of operations and
                                manages round counters.

  **Top Level**                 : Connects all modules and defines the
                                system I/O.

## Simulation

Each module was verified through waveform simulations: - Constant
addition, substitution, and diffusion were tested individually.
- The permutation module and state machine were validated through
simulation of multiple rounds.
- The top-level testbench (`ascon_top_tb.sv`) integrates all modules to
produce final encryption outputs.
